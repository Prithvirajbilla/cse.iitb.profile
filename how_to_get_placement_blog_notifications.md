I'm going to tell you how to get the new post in  placement blog as notifications via email, sms or android push notifications, whatever you want.


#Step 1.

Go to http://ifttt.com (If This Then That) and create an account.

#Step 2.

Activate the channels  sms,android notifications,android calls ,Android Sms whatever you want.

#Step 3.

Start Creating a new recipe.

Choose this channel as "feed", and the trigger as "new feed" and action what ever you like (For example sending an email, sms to yourself).

Or You can use my recipes (Which i'm already using)

Feed url is http://home.iitb.ac.in/~prithviraj/placementfeed.php (The placement blog feed url doesn't work with ifttt because of some authorisation headers). The polling is done to check whether if a new post is posted or not happens every 15 minutes. so you can expect some delay.

Some carriers don't support sms service and some don't support sending sms during night.

#Step 4.

Get all the notifications and Stay Awesome IITB.
